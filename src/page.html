		<h3>Biography</h3>

		<p>A wearer of many hats, literally, Karl came to Neontribe in 2013 after a period of rest from a fifteen year spell at one of the world's brokest Banks. He initially started his IT career in November 1996 within the call centre of Richard Branson’s Virgin Direct before moving to a testing role and proceeded to work his way through the ranks to the dizzy heights of Test Manager with the then Virgin One Account.</p>

		<p>After a number of re-organisational moves within the wider area of the bank, found himself in a service delivery manager role, juggling a wide variety of teams and projects across the broader spectrum of the bank, from Edinburgh to Mumbai and back again. Eventually they caught up with him and he was allowed to leave in Sept 2011.</p>

		<p>Refreshed and liberated, he has embraced the Neontribe work ethic (even growing a moustache) and has been tasked with bringing a level of structure and project management into the team whilst maintaining the fun in delivering brilliant projects.</p>

		<p>Programming</p>
		<p>Cat rejected the family tradition of becoming a teacher, and broke out from a high school background of Literature and biology to pursue a degree in Computer Science. Originally, the plan was to be a games designer and developer, to reunite the worlds of arts and science, but the maths-heavy and highly competitive world of graphics lost its appeal quickly. Cat's 3<sup>rd</sup> year project for her degree was a prototype mobile phone application for tracking mood. She graduated from the University of East Anglia in 2013 with a 2:1 in Computer Science.</p>
